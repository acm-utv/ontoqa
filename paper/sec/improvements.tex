\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:improvements}

The main improvements to plan for our solution concerns the ontology and the parsing algorithm.
%
The redefinition of ontological class hierarchy and the extension of the domain of knowledge should be addressed.
%
Furthermore, the parser should be extended providing it with the caching of common LTAG/DUDES compositions and feasibility to speed up the syntactic and semantic disambiguation.

Other possible improvements involve the libraries used to implement our solution
%
In this sense, the library provided by the "Semantic Computing Group @ Bielefeld University" could be extended, since it does not completely cover the properties of Lemon and Lexinfo, but only the most common ones.
%
Similarly, a pull project of the DUDES library could be proposed, so to resolve some bugs and enhance the library usability with a wider use of clean code and software design patterns.

Finally, the evaluation framework should be extended with more complex questions and should take into account also the memory usage.
