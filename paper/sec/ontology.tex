The domain chosen for our ontology is "Organizations". The domain ontology expresses the links between specific objects and events of that domain through classes (or concepts), properties and attributes of the classes, constraints and instances. The ontology has been modelled to answer the benchmark questions, though it is not strictly limited to them.
The concepts we want to represent are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The companies.
\item People who play an important role in the company.
\item A nation for the nationality of people or for the headquarter of a company.
\end{itemize}
The symbols we used to represent this sets are: \textit{Company, Person} and \textit{Nation}.
Then we need symbols to represent the relationships between classes. The relationships we needed are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A person who is the founder of a company.
\item A person who is the CEO of a company.
\item A person who is the CFO of a company.
\item A person who is the Chairman of a company.
\item A person who is the Corporate Officer of a company.
\item A company acquiring a company.
\item The nationality of people.
\item The nation where the headquarter of a company is located.
\end{itemize}
The symbols we used to represent these relationships are: \textit{hasFounder, hasCEO, hasCFO, hasChairman, hasCorporateOfficer, isAcquiredBy, hasNationality} and \textit{hasHeadquarter}. 

We also introduced some attribute to classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item The net income of an organization.
\item The market value of a company. For a publicly traded company the market
value is referred to the market capitalization. For smaller companies, subsidiaries whose business operations and investments are controlled by the parent corporation, the market value is referred to value at which a company is acquired.
\end{itemize}
The symbols we used to represent these attributes are: \textit{ netIncome} and \textit{marketValue}.
Both the net income and the purchase price are in \textit{billion U.S. dollars}. To note that a billion, in American English, has always equated to a thousand million (i.e. 1'000'000'000).

In order to prevent a computer program to use the symbols '\textit{in the wrong way}' we have introduced  constraints on the way the vocabulary is used:
\begin{itemize}
\item a person can not be a company and a company can not be a person.
\item people must have at least one nationality.
\item companies must have at least one headquarter. 
\end{itemize}

The reader can refer to the files \textit{organizationVersion2.ttl} in the \textit{data/knowledge} package and \textit{organizationNotInfVersion2.ttl} in \textit{data/knowledge/protégé} to see the ontology in detail. The first file is obtained merging the inferred and asserted information of our ontology. The second one contains only the asserted informations.  

At the \textit{data/knowledge} path there is also the first version of the ontology in which the ambiguity between the nationality of a person and the nation for the headquarter of a company is resolved.

Below an entity-relationship model (ER model) for the specific domain of knowledge about \textit{Organizations}.
