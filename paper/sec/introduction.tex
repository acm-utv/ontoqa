% NLP
Natural Language Processing is a theoretically motivated range of
computational techniques for analyzing and representing naturally occurring texts
at one or more levels of linguistic analysis for the purpose of achieving human-like
language processing for a range of tasks or applications \cite{liddy2001natural}.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:background} gives the background, useful to better understand our work;
Section~\ref{sec:architecture} shows the architecture implemented in our solution;
Section~\ref{sec:grammar} shows the grammar used to parse the natural language;
Section~\ref{sec:ontology} shows the ontology used to semantically represent the reference domain;
Section~\ref{sec:parsing} shows the algorithm used for question parsing;
Section~\ref{sec:implementation} shows how the application has been implemented, with a focus on the adopted technologies;
Section~\ref{sec:sample-execution} shows some notable parsing executions;
Section~\ref{sec:further-improvements} outlines the possible improvements for the proposed work;
Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} concludes this article, summarizing our work and results.
