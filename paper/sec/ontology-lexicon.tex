\section{Ontology Lexicon}
\label{sec:ontology-lexicon}


The Ontology Lexica is generated by the lemon Design Pattern Library. We wrote a file with \textit{.ldp} extension containing the ontology lexica in lemon Design Pattern language and then we use the lemon patterns to convert it to \textit{RDF/XML} file. 
The semantic vocabulary used to represent the meaning of words have to correspond to the vocabulary of the ontology. We used the following lemon design patterns to represent words:
\begin{itemize}
\item common nouns, e.g. \textit{company, person} and \textit{nation}, and their other forms (e.g. plural form) are \textit{ClassNouns} in lemon pattern language.
\item all the properties, e.g. \textit{hasFounder, hasChairman, ...} are expressed as \textit{relational nouns} (\textit{RelationalNoun} in lemon pattern language) and represent relations between two entities that are expressed in sentences as nouns.
\item for named individuals in the domain we used the \textit{Name(...)} form.
\item for the verbs we needed in our domain we have defined the present and the past form but any other form can be easily added in the \textit{StateVerb(...)} pattern.
\item adjectives, as \textit{italian, american} end so on,are expressed with the \textit{IntersectiveObjectPropertyAdjective(...)} pattern. In the \textit{organizationWithAmbiguity.ldp} file located in \textit{data/lexicon/} these adjectives create ambiguities. For example, the lexical entry \textit{italian} is related first to the \textit{hasNationality} property and then to \textit{hasHeadquarter} property. Is the same with all other adjectives, e.g. \textit{american, russian,} and so on. 
\item the superlative form is expressed as a \textit{ScalarAdjective} (in the \textit{covariant} form) in lemon language. Consider the \textit{valuable} adjective in the superlative form "\textit{the most valuable}", the extent to which a company is \textit{valuable} is proportional (or \textit{covariant}) to its market value.
\item finally we defined relational adjectives as "\textit{headquartered in}" with the \textit{RelationalAdjective} form.
\end{itemize}
