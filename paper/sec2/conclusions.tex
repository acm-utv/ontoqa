\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work we described Ontoqa, a Q\&A web and standalone application which aims to adapt easily to distinct ontologies and lexicons.
%
The proposed solution leverages ontology-driven NLP through the use of the LTAG/DUDES model and a greedy parsing algorithm aiming to reduce both the syntactic and semantic search space.
%
%
% RESULTS
The experimental results show that our system can answer the benchmark questions, with good performance with respect to both response-time and memory usage. 
%
%
% CONCLUSIONS
Our work shows that ontology alignment through the LTAG/DUDES model permits 
high modularization and generalization of the NLP process.
%
Furthermore, such a model suits well to the design of parsing algorithms that can effectively minimize both the syntactic and semantic search space.
